Shcripts
---------------------------------

Some BASH scripts that I use and I think might be useful for others as well! It also includes some Python2 scripts meant for command-line usage.

* `command_logging.sh`_ : Seperate&join out and err, truncate logs, add timestamps; see `logging`_.
* `pinyin_tones.py`_ : Add tone marks instead of numbers to Pinyin; use as ``python pinyin_tones.py ni3hao3``.
* `macro_record.sh`_ / `macro_play.sh`_ : Record and play back keyboard macros on Ubuntu; see `Ubuntu macros`_.
* `json_zoom.py`_ : Explore big json files; use as ``python json_zoom.py file.json key1 key2 ind3`` or see -h.

Some of these might rely on BASH or Ubuntu features and might not be immediately portable...
