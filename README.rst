Shcripts
---------------------------------

Some BASH scripts that I use and I think might be useful for others as well! It also includes some Python2 scripts meant for command-line usage.

* command_logging.sh : Log stdout and stderr separately and together; see https://markv.nl/blog/logging-to-files
* pinyin_tones.py : Add tone marks instead of numbers to Pinyin; use as ``python pinyin_tones.py ni3hao3``
* macro_record.sh / macro_play.sh : Record and play back keyboard macros on Ubuntu; see https://markv.nl/blog/ubuntu-macros (Ubuntu)
* json_zoom.py : Explore big json files; use as ``python json_zoom.py file.json key1 key2 ind3`` or see -h

Some of these might rely on BASH or Ubuntu features and might not be immediately portable...
