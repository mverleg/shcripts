Shcripts
---------------------------------

Some BASH scripts that I use and I think might be useful for others as well! It also includes some Python2 scripts meant for command-line usage.

* command_logging.sh : see https://markv.nl/blog/logging-to-files
* pinyin_tones.py : Use as ``python pinyin_tones.py ni3hao3``
* macro_record.sh / macro_play.sh : see https://markv.nl/blog/ubuntu-macros (Ubuntu)

Some of these might rely on BASH or Ubuntu features and might not be immediately portable...
